Perfect — this is a **different psychological context**, so the card **must feel different**, even if it visually belongs to the same design system.

I’ll act as a **world-class UI/UX expert** and write **clear, non-code UI instructions** for a frontend dev.

# 🐾 Rehoming Pet Card (Public / Pet Seeker View)

**Context:**
This card is shown to **potential adopters** browsing pets to welcome into their home.
The goal of the card is **selection + emotional connection**, not management.

> Think: *“Can I imagine this pet in my life?”*

---

## 🎯 Core UX Goal

* Help users **quickly filter & shortlist**
* Create **emotional attraction without overwhelming**
* Encourage **click-through to pet detail page**
* Build **trust & safety signals subtly**

---

## 🧠 Psychological Principles to Apply

* **Face-first bias** → Pet image is the emotional hook
* **Cognitive ease** → Minimal, scannable info
* **Trust heuristics** → Verified & location signals
* **Urgency framing** → Without panic or guilt
* **Choice reduction** → Avoid overload in list view

---

## 🧱 Card Layout Structure (Top → Bottom)

---

## 1️⃣ Media Section (Primary Attention Anchor)

### Main Photo

* Use `pet.main_photo`
* Full-width image
* Aspect ratio: **4:3**
* Rounded top corners
* Subtle gradient overlay at bottom for text readability

### Image Badges (Top-left or Top-right)

Show **at most 2 small badges**:

* **Urgency Badge**

  * Based on `urgency`
  * Examples:

    * `Immediate` → Red / Orange (⚠️ Immediate)
    * `Soon` → Amber
    * `Flexible` → Soft Green
* **Status Badge**

  * `status: active` → “Available”

> ❗ Avoid showing internal statuses like “draft” or “paused” here

---

## 2️⃣ Pet Identity Block (First Cognitive Scan)

### Pet Name (Primary)

* `pet.name`
* Large, friendly typography
* Emotion-first — this is the **headline**

### Quick Meta Line (Single Line)

Format:

> **Species • Breed • Age • Gender**

Example:

> Cat • Persian • 0 years • Male

* Uses `species`, `breed`, `age_display`, `gender`
* Use icons subtly (🐱 ♂️ 🎂)

---

## 3️⃣ Emotional Compatibility Indicators (Key Differentiator)

### Personality Preview (Max 3 Chips)

From pet traits (if available later) or inferred basics:

* Friendly
* Calm
* Playful
* Good with kids (if applicable)

**Rules:**

* Max **3 traits only**
* Rounded soft chips
* Neutral positive tone
* No scrolling inside card

> 💡 This helps users *self-filter emotionally*

---

## 4️⃣ Location & Trust Signals (Reassurance Layer)

### Location

* Show:

  * `location_city`, `location_state`
* Use subtle pin icon
* Secondary text style

### Owner Trust Indicator (Minimal, Non-invasive)

* Show **one combined trust label**, not raw booleans:

  * If `verified_identity` or `pet_owner_verified` →
    ✅ “Verified Owner”
  * Else →
    ℹ️ “Owner profile available”

> ❌ Never show `false / true` directly
> ❌ Never shame the owner

---

## 5️⃣ Engagement Signals (Social Proof)

Show **small, muted counters**:

* 👀 `view_count` views
* ❤️ `application_count` interested

Placement:

* Bottom-left
* Secondary importance

> This subtly indicates demand without creating pressure

---

## 6️⃣ Call-to-Action (Primary Conversion Trigger)

### Primary CTA Button

* Text: **“View Details”**
* Full-width
* Friendly tone
* High contrast but not aggressive

### Optional Secondary Action (Icon only)

* Save / Bookmark (♡)
* Tooltip: “Save for later”

> ❗ No “Apply” button here — that belongs on the detail page

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Show on This Card

These belong to **detail view only**:

* Rehoming `reason`
* Microchip info
* Owner full name
* Owner photo
* Privacy level
* Medical details
* Full description text

---

## 🎨 Visual Tone Guidelines

* Softer colors than dashboard cards
* More warmth, less control
* Rounded corners (more than admin/dashboard cards)
* Subtle shadow to suggest “life & warmth”

---

## 🔁 Relation to User Dashboard Pet Card

| User Dashboard Card | Public Rehoming Card        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ownership-focused   | Emotion & selection-focused |
| Status-heavy        | Compatibility-heavy         |
| Management actions  | Discovery actions           |
| Neutral tone        | Warm & inviting             |

---

## 🧪 Edge Case Handling

* If photo missing → friendly placeholder illustration
* If urgency = immediate → badge visible but **no flashing**
* If view/application count = 0 → hide counters (don’t show zero)

---

## 🧠 Final Mental Model for Dev

> **Dashboard card = “This is my responsibility”**
> **Rehoming card = “This could be my companion”**

If you want, next I can:

* Compare **public vs dashboard card side-by-side**
* Design **hover states & micro-interactions**
* Review **RehomingIntervention model UX implications**
* Define **empty state & loading skeleton behavior**

Just tell me 👌
