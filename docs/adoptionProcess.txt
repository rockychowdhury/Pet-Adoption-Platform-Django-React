## ⚖️ BUSINESS RULES & EDGE CASES

### **Rule 1: One Adopted Pet Per Application**
- Each application is for ONE specific pet
- If user wants multiple pets, must submit separate applications
- Platform enforces this at submission

### **Rule 2: Application Expiration**
- If `PENDING` > 7 days with no shelter action → auto-reminder
- If `PENDING` > 14 days → auto-escalation to admin
- If `APPROVED` but no visit scheduled in 30 days → application expires, status → `EXPIRED`

### **Rule 3: Pet Availability Precedence**
- First to `ADOPTED` status wins
- Other applications for same pet → auto `REJECTED` with message: "Pet has been adopted by another applicant. Here are similar pets..."

### **Rule 4: Visit No-Show Policy**
- 1st no-show: Warning email, reschedule allowed
- 2nd no-show: Application suspended 7 days
- 3rd no-show: Application auto-rejected

### **Rule 5: Home Check Requirement Override**
- Only shelter staff (not volunteers) can skip home check
- Admin can force home check requirement
- Audit log tracks all skip decisions

### **Rule 6: Rejection Appeal Process**
- Applicant can appeal rejection within 14 days
- Appeal goes to different shelter staff member
- Admin reviews if unresolved
- Decision final after appeal

### **Rule 7: Adoption Return Policy**
- Within 30 days: Full refund (if fee paid), no questions asked
- 30-90 days: Case-by-case, pet must return to shelter
- After 90 days: Pet must return, but considered separate surrender

### **Rule 8: Concurrent Application Limit**
- User can have max 5 active applications simultaneously
- Prevents spamming shelters
- Can apply to new pets after withdrawing/rejection

### **Rule 9: Cooling-Off Period After Rejection**
- Same pet: Cannot reapply for 90 days
- Same shelter (different pet): Can apply immediately
- Platform enforces automatically

### **Rule 10: Emergency Adoption Override**
- Admin/Shelter Manager can skip all steps in emergencies
- Examples: Natural disaster, pet medical emergency, previous adopter
- Requires written justification, logged

- Average review time (target: < 48 hours)
- Approval rate (healthy: 60-70%)
- Adoption finalization rate (approved → adopted) (target: > 80%)
- 30-day adoption success (target: > 90%)
- Return rate (target: < 10%)

### **Platform Efficiency:**
- Application completion rate (target: > 85%)
- Time to adoption (submission → finalized) (target: < 21 days)
- Applicant satisfaction score (post-adoption survey) (target: > 4.5/5)
- Shelter time saved per application (benchmark: 3 hours)

### **Animal Welfare:**
- Adoption success rate (pet remains in home after 1 year) (target: > 85%)
- Return reasons (categorized for improvement)
- Health check compliance (vet visit within 10 days) (target: > 95%)

## 🚨 RED FLAGS & AUTO-ALERTS

**Platform auto-alerts shelter if:**
- Application from previously banned user
-References indicate concerns
- Vet verification fails/returns negative info
- Applicant has multiple concurrent applications (> 3)
- Application information inconsistent (address mismatch, etc.)
- Home check reveals safety issues
- Follow-up survey indicates problems
- Multiple no-shows
- Social media red flags (if integrated, optional)

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES FOR SHELTERS

1. **Respond to applications within 24 hours** (even if just "we received it")
2. **Use platform templates** for consistent communication
3. **Document everything** in platform notes (not external systems)
4. **Be compassionate in rejections** - use platform's templated messages
5. **Don't skip home checks** for high-risk scenarios (first-time owners, special needs pets)
6. **Follow up post-adoption** - use platform's automated schedule
7. **Update pet profiles** immediately when status changes
8. **Review analytics monthly** to identify improvement areas
9. **Train staff** on platform features (reduces errors)
10. **Celebrate adoptions publicly** (social sharing tools built-in)

## 🎯 SUCCESS DEFINITION

An adoption process is successful when:
- ✅ Pet finds a permanent, loving home
- ✅ Adopter is prepared and satisfied
- ✅ Shelter's welfare standards met
- ✅ Legal compliance maintained
- ✅ Process is efficient and transparent
- ✅ Animal remains in home long-term (> 1 year)

---

## 🔄 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

**Platform should:**
- A/B test communication templates (response rates)
- Analyze rejection patterns (improve matching algorithm)
- Survey both successful and failed adoptions
- Update contract templates based on legal changes
- Gather shelter feedback quarterly
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Implement AI/ML for better matching over time
